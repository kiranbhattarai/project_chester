    <p><li>In 1993, he became a part of his first band, ‘Sean Dowdell and His Friends?’ which was a grunge rock band. That year they came out with a three track cassette.</li>
    <li>Later in 1993, he joined the band, ‘Grey Daze’ and recorded the singles, ‘Wake Me’, ‘Demo in’ and ‘No Sun Today’. However, he wasn’t contented with the same as he was not given due credit. Unhappy about the same, he left the band in 1998.</li>
    <li>He later joined ‘Linkin Park’ and in 2000 and the band released their debut album, ‘Hybrid Theory’, for which he gave the vocals. The album achieved much success and achieved a blockbuster status. It entered the US Billboard charts at number 16 and soon became the best-selling album of the year.</li>
    <li>In 2003, he gave the vocals for the ‘Linkin Park’ album, ‘Meteora’, which was released under the Warner Bros. Records label. The album included the hit song, ‘Numb’. The album earned instant worldwide recognition and catapulted to the number 1 position in the US and UK chart and number 2 in Australia immediately after release.</li>
    <li>In 2005, he founded his own rock band named the ‘Dead by Sunrise’, which he claimed he founded because some of the songs that he had written were good but did not sync well with ‘Linkin Park’ style.</li>
    <li>In 2006, he played the role of a pharmacy customer, adrenaline junkie in the American action film, ‘Crank’. The film was directed by Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor.</li>
    <li>His third album ‘Minutes to Midnight’ was released in 2007. With over 600,000 copies in its first week and gaining the top spot on the Billboard Charts, it became one of the most successful albums.</li>
    <li>On October 13, 2009, as a part of the band ‘Dead by Sunrise’, he came out with the band’s debut album, ‘Out of Ashes’. The album was moderately successful.</li>
    <li>In 2010, he gave the vocals for the Linkin Park’ fourth album, ‘A Thousand Suns’, which was a muti-concept album that highlighted the concept of nuclear warfare. The album received positive reviews.</li>
    <li>In October 2010, he appeared in a minor role in the 3D horror film, ‘Saw 3D’, which was directed by Kevin Greutert. The film was not well received by critics but it was a success at the box office.</li>

    <li>In 1996, he tied the knot with Samantha Marie Olit. The couple was blessed with a child, Draven Sebastian Bennington. The two divorced in 2005.</li>
    <li>On July 20, 2017, his lifeless body was found in his home. He had apparently committed suicide by hanging. It is reported that he had been very upset following the suicide death of his friend Chris Cornell in May 2017. Bennington’s suicide occurred on what would have been Cornell's 53rd birthday</li>
